## Update

**Cautions**

- There may be a time where the deps are too out of date. They need to be out of date for `update` to update them,
  so just bump them up to the release before the latest std

**How it Works**

- This benchmark uses a separate `deps.ts` file. The reason for this is so we can have a 'realworld' example, where many dependencies are used, and from various registries

- All but 1 dependency are out of date, to fully represent the test, as the `update` would update all the out of date dependencies

- This benchmark shows the execution time for running `update` against 14 separate dependencies, all varying from:
  - deno.land/std/
  - deno.land/x/
  - x.nest.land

**How to Run**

```
cd nest.land/eggs/benchmarks/commands/update
deno run --allow-run update_benchmark.ts
```
